# FrechetTreeDistance

This repository contains all code and data for the manuscript "A Fréchet tree distance measure to compare phylogeographic spread paths across trees". It includes the raw data, the results, a pipeline to replicate the analysis and an implementation of the Fréchet tree distance to measure differences between phylogeographic spread paths.

## Data
[This folder](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/FrechetTreeDistance/tree/master/Data) contains the raw data that is needed to start the analysis as well as the resulting phylogenetic trees with the inferred locations for all nodes.

## Figures&Tables
[This folder](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/FrechetTreeDistance/tree/master/Figures%26Tables) contains all figures and tables in the manuscript. Further, the [XML files](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/FrechetTreeDistance/tree/master/Figures%26Tables/XML%20files) that were used as input for [GraPhlAn](https://bitbucket.org/nsegata/graphlan/wiki/Home) to visualize the phylogenetic trees are included.

## Software
[This folder](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/FrechetTreeDistance/tree/master/Software) contains scripts to generate all trees and perform the phylogeographic reconstruction, the implementation of the Fréchet tree distance as well as a script to plot the pairwise distances using multidimensional scaling. A pipeline is included which combines all these steps and allows to replicate the analysis in the manuscript. Information how to run the scripts are given in [an additional readme file](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/FrechetTreeDistance/blob/master/Software/README.md).
